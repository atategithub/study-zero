<h2>THE GIFT</h2><br>

by <br>
<h4>Vladimir NABOKOV</h4>

<p>translated from the Russian by <strong>Michael Scammell</strong> with the collaboration of the author</p>

<h3>WEIDENFELD AND NICOLSON</h3>

<p>First published in England in November, 1923</p>


<p>One cloudy but luminous day, towards four in the afternoon on <strong>April</strong> the first, 192- <br>
(a <i>foreign critic</i> once remarked that while many novels, most <em>German</em> ones for example, begin with a date, it is only Russian authors who,<br>
in keeping with the honesty peculiar to <i>our literature</i>, omit the final digit) a moving van, very long and very yellow, <br>
hitched to a tractor that was also yellow, with hypertrophied rear wheels and a shamelessly exposed <br>
anatomy, pulled up in front of <u>Number Seven</u> <strong>Tannenberg Street</strong> , in the west part of Berlin. The vanâ€™s forehead bore a star-shaped 
ventilator. <br>
</p>
<p>Running along its entire side was the name of the moving company in yard-high blue letters,<br>
each of which (including a square dot) was shaded laterally with black paint: a dishonest attempt to climb<br>
into the next dimension. On the sidewalk, before the house (in which I too shall dwell), stood two people who had obviously <br>
come out to meet their furniture (in my suitcase there are more manuscripts than shirts). <br>
The man, arrayed in a rough <strong>greenish-brown overcoat</strong> to which the wind imparted a ripple of life, was tall, beetle-browed and old, <br>
with the grey of his whiskers turning to russet in the area of the mouth, in which he insensitively held a cold, half-defoliated cigar butt.<br></p>
<p>The woman, thickset and no longer young, with bowlegs and a rather attractive pseudo-Chinese face, <br>
wore an <em>astrakhan</em> jacket; the wind, having rounded her, brought a whiff of rather good but slightly stale perfume.<br>
 They both stood motionless and watched fixedly, with such attentiveness that one might think they were about to be short-changed, <br>
as three red-necked husky fellows in blue aprons wrestled <u>with their furniture.</u><br></p>
 
<p><strong><i>Some day, he thought, I must use such a scene to start a good
thick old-fashioned novel.</i></strong></p>
