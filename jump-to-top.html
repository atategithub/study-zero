    <h3><i>International Youth Culture Centre glows with colorful LED lighting</i></h3>
    April 01, 2015

    <p>A building in Nanjing, China, has become a colorful addition<br> to the city's skyline.
    The International Youth Culture Centre features an LED system from Philips <br>that has 700,000 nodes
    and a palette of 16 million colors. Despite this, it reportedly costs <br>less than â‚¬114 (US$122) per day to light.
</p>
    <p>The building was designed by Zaha Hadid, whose design for the Heydar Aliyev Center<br> in Baku, Azerbaijan,
    won last year's London Design Museum's<br> Design of the Year award.<br> Like the Heydar Aliyev Center, the International
    Youth Culture Centre features<br> Hadid's trademark curved forms, although <br>they are perhaps a little more understated
    here than elsewhere.</p><br>
    <p>The 700,000 nodes used as part of the installation are<br> Philips iColor Flex MX LED units.<br>
    They are provided as strands of units and said to be flexible <br>in how and where they can be installed.
    The LED nodes used are also said to be especially energy-efficient,<br> saving up to 60 percent in electricity
    used<br> compared to normal colored LED lighting.</p><br>
    <p>Philips says that, in this instance, they help to accentuate the fluidity and curves<br> of the International Youth
    Culture Centre.</p>
    <p>In addition to the iColor Flex MX units,<br> Philips Vaya Linear LED lights are installed <br>as means of creating
    "striking vertical lines" <br>that can be seen running up the buildings.<br> Philips Vaya Flood LED lights, meanwhile,
    are <br>employed to project into the night sky from the top of the towers,<br> giving the impression of the towers
    being even taller.</p><br>
